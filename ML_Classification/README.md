## ML Classification.

this project indicates to review machine learning abilities to classify the BOA tuple of network traffic sample.
it includes several notebooks which refers to an experiment been made while examing the ability of classification in our proposes.
Additionally, the robustness of the models been measured in several cases like unseen data,
permuting learning values and generating samples.


notebooks are ordered and determinate to find a preferable machine learning algorithm and optimized features set for robust classification of the mentioned data.
it starts with detecting the behavior of several machine learning algorithms facing out dataset,
then getting familiar with the features and making optimization,
and last testing several cases on adversarial intervention. 


tools that have been used to implement this project are Python3, Anaconda, Jupyter notebook, and mainly Pycaret package.
Pycaret serves a great learning function as setting a classifier object, compare known learning models, build tune, and test a selected model.
Pycaret using IPython for the environment, and Pandas object as data.
